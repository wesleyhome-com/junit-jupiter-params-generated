# junit-jupiter-params-generated
This library is an extension to JUnit Jupiters parameterized test functionality. 
This library will generate all parameter permutations for a parameterized test just by inpecting the type, and including annotations for certain types to tell the extension the acceptable values. 

See some examples in the [WIKI Examples Section](https://github.com/wesleyhome-com/junit-jupiter-params-generated/wiki#examples).
